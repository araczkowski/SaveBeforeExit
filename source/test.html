	To enable the reverting you only need to add a jQuery selector for items to rever<br />
	The Ignore Modifications Selector setting accepts a jQuery selector used to include elements to the restore list after cancel the navigation.<br />
	The following jQuery selector could be used to exclude a rich text editor:</p>
<p style="margin-left:.5in;">
	#P25_VACATION_0,#P25_VACATION_1</p>
